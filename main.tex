% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
DDoS-for-Hire services allow anyone to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks with the click of a button. To showcase their capabilities, these services often rely on third-party platforms that provide ``DDoS Power Proofs'', where users can see real-time graphs of the traffic generated during an attack. These platforms, known as DStat services, aggregate data from publicly exposed monitoring endpoints to display the current bandwidth usage and uplink capacities of various DDoS-for-Hire services. In this paper, we investigate the infrastructure behind DStat services, analyze the attacks performed on their endpoints, and explore the market dynamics of DDoS Power Proofs on Telegram. Our findings reveal that DStat services abuse publicly exposed monitoring endpoints, allowing them to operate without significant investment in infrastructure. We observe a wide range of attack sizes and characteristics, shedding light on the capabilities of DDoS-for-Hire services. Furthermore, our analysis of Telegram groups uncovers the social dynamics and promotional strategies employed by DDoS-for-Hire providers.
